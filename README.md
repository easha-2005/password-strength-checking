🔐 Password Strength Evaluation
✅ Objective
To understand the characteristics of strong passwords by:

Creating a range of passwords with varying complexity

Evaluating them using online strength checker tools

Analyzing their vulnerability to attacks

Learning best practices for secure password creation

🧪 Tested Passwords and Results
No.	Password	Complexity Elements Used	Strength Score	Estimated Time to Crack	Tool Used
1	password123	Common word + numbers	Very Weak	Less than 1 second	password.kaspersky.com
2	Easha@2025	Name + special character + number	Weak	~2 minutes	passwordmeter.com
3	SecureMe!21	Uppercase + lowercase + symbols + digits	Moderate	Few hours	security.org
4	Th!sIs$tr0nGPass	Mixed case + digits + symbols	Strong	Trillions of years	password.kaspersky.com
5	ILoveMyDog2025!	Phrase + number + symbol	Moderate to Strong	Billions of years	passwordmeter.com
6	Blue$Tiger97#Cloud	Passphrase + mixed characters + symbols	Very Strong	>10 Trillion years	security.org
7	aB#9dK!zq$2&F	Randomized characters + symbols	Very Strong	Practically uncrackable	password.kaspersky.com
8	T3ch$Genius!@#2025	Tech phrase + digits + multiple symbols	Strong	1+ Trillion years	security.org
9	R@in$And$Sh1nE2025	Words + substitution + digits + symbols	Strong	500+ Billion years	passwordmeter.com
10	42Monkeys!Jump#Sky	Fun phrase + number + symbol + randomness	Very Strong	Extremely long	password.kaspersky.com

🧠 Analysis of Password Strength
Weak Passwords
password123, Easha@2025

Use common words or names

Predictable patterns

Easily broken by dictionary or brute force attacks

Moderate Passwords
SecureMe!21, ILoveMyDog2025!

Better complexity and symbols

Still vulnerable if personal or guessable

Strong Passwords
Th!sIs$tr0nGPass, Blue$Tiger97#Cloud, aB#9dK!zq$2&F

Long, random, uses all character types

Takes trillions of years to crack with brute force

📚 Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description
Brute Force	Tries every possible combination until correct one is found
Dictionary Attack	Uses list of known/common words and passwords to guess login
Phishing	Tricks users into entering credentials on fake websites
Credential Stuffing	Uses stolen credentials from one site to try logging into other services

💡 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
Length Matters: Use at least 12–16 characters.

Complexity Counts: Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Avoid Predictability:

Don’t use names, birthdays, or common words.

Don’t reuse old or compromised passwords.

Passphrases Are Powerful:

Use unrelated but memorable words or phrases.

Example: 42Monkeys!Jump#Sky

Password Manager:

Use tools like Bitwarden or LastPass to store and generate strong passwords.

Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):

Add an extra layer of protection beyond just the password.
